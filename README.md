# 📊 Research Task 05: Descriptive Statistics + LLM Validation

## 🏀 Dataset:
- **Title**: Syracuse Men’s Basketball 2024–2025 Stats
- **Format**: CSV (converted from Excel)
- **Size**: 32 rows, 16 players

## 🧮 Python Workflow:
- Used `csv`, `statistics`, and `collections` libraries
- Performed:
  - Overall descriptive stats (mean, std, min, max)
  - Grouped player-level stats
  - Identified top scorer, rebounder, and consistent performers
- File: `python_stats.ipynb`

## 🤖 LLM Workflow:
- LLM Used: **ChatGPT-4**
- Asked 3 key natural language questions:
  1. Who is the top scorer?
  2. Who had the highest rebound average?
  3. Who is the most consistent performer?

## ✅ Evaluation Summary:
- All 3 LLM responses were **correct** or **reasonable**
- Consistency question relied on human interpretation
- LLMs do well with clear, structured numeric questions

## 📁 Files:
- `python_stats.ipynb`: Python stats script
- `llm_prompts.md`: Prompts and LLM responses
- `summary_table.md`: Accuracy table
